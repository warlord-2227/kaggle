#           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
#           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

# 
#       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
#       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
#       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

#       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
#       the conditions stated in this License.
# 
#    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
#       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

# 
#    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
#       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
#       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
#       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
#       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
#       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
#       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
#       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
#       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
#       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
#       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
# 
#    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

#       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
#       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"""Kaggriculture route-replay chassis (pure Python, stdlib only).

A *route* is a pre-computed tape of 719 Kaggle-format actions
``{"farmer": [op, ...], "hands": [[op, ...], ...], "market": [[order, item, qty], ...]}``.
The chassis replays the tape chosen by a caller-supplied ``router`` and wraps it
in small reactive layers (each independently switchable via ``settings``):

    hand_align            pad/truncate hands to the real hand count      (fieldbook_logic)
    weed_repair           DIG a weed that blocks PLANT/BUILD, replay      (tetsutani + task spec)
    sell_lead             sell next step's lots one step early            (fieldbook _lead_sale)
    front_run             sell before the opponent's scheduled SELL       (hook; opponent_plan)
    budget_guard          fund each 72-step block's purchases             (six_day_budget_guard.hpp)
    room_guard            keep shed <= 99 at hour 23                      (tetsutani)
    clamp_sells           trim SELL orders to the projected shed          (tetsutani)
    dead_stock            sell stock the route will never sell            (tetsutani)
    terminal_liquidation  step >= 718: sell the whole projected shed      (fieldbook _terminal_sale)

# v9 FERT: spend carried fertilizer on young wheat and carrots.
#
# Workers that tend animals carry collected fertilizer back to the shed, where
# the tape sells it into a book that falls from $55 on day 14 to $10 by day 27.
# On a short crop the same unit is worth far more: a watered wheat plant ends at
# 4 units, but fertilized for its yield window it caps at 6.  A worker that
# carries fertilizer and is about to water a wheat or carrot plant one day
# after planting (watered on planting day, not yet fertilized) fertilizes it
# instead; the tape waters it again on the following days.  Fertilizer the
# worker's own tape commands still spend today is left alone, and the layer only
# acts from day 16, once the fertilizer book is worth less than two wheat.

# and then runs days 0-9 with only ~$6 of cash slack (minimum at step 32).
# The round trip wins cash from rivals whose own opening buys into it, but
# against openings that dump wheat in the same slots (e.g. BUY 43 / SELL 20 /
# SELL 22 or BUY 30 / SELL all) it ends step 1 up to $75 short; the day-1
# wheat and hire orders then fail, the herd goes unfed, and by days 5-8 the
# strawberry seed orders fail too (18-21 plants instead of 33, -20k..-65k).
#
# Replacing it with BUY 10, SELL 5 at step 0 (still net +5, nothing at
# step 1) leaves >= $1,050 after step 1 against all 6,648 recorded openings
# in the metav2 / M&M replays (exact market simulation, build/v9/opensim.py),

# v9 RACE: fit the sale-reservation horizon to the rival's observed sale lead.
#
# Premium books crash within ~60 units of glut, so the first seller of a lot
# takes the price and the second sells into the crash.  The parent reserves
# planned tape sales a fixed four turns ahead; any deeper fixed horizon beats
# it head-to-head, but selling earlier than necessary gives away town-demand
# recovery against a rival that does not race.
#
# Everything here is public.  Each turn the rival's executed sales are
#
#   rival_sold[p] = inventory'[p] - inventory[p] + town_draw[p] - own_sold[p]
#
# (exact above the $1 floor, where sales never enter inventory).  When the
# rival sells a product while we still hold stock that our tape sells later,
# and the sale is not a late fill of our previous lot, the turns until our next
# planned sale are the rival's lead.  One horizon serves every product:
#
#   horizon = clamp(largest lead seen + RACE_MARGIN, RACE_DEFAULT, RACE_MAX)
#
# and it also lifts the parent's 72-turn block bound (patched into the
# parent's reservation by the release builder).
#
# v9/2: the shipped horizon is 40 turns with a 12-turn margin (was 6 and 4).
# Mirrors are the ladder's real opponent, and the premium books are first-come
# races, so reserve depth is the whole decision.  Against the 6/4 build the new
# setting wins 73-7 (+308) over 80 mirror games; against the shipped 32/12 build
# it wins 74-6 (+358).  Deeper is not better: 44/12 beats 40 head to head but
# drops the shallow-baseline record to 65-15, and 48/12 (a constant 48) falls to
# 14-26 against it, because a horizon past the rival's next lot gives up
# town-demand recovery for nothing.  The frozen top-30 stream panel is unchanged
# inside its noise (52.2% / +2,797 over 178 games vs 52.8% / +2,929 at 32/12) and
# the public field still goes 8-0.
#
# v9/2b: the reservation window starts at step 192 (day 8) instead of 288 (day 12),
# a one-line change in the parent's `_r36_reserve` gate made by the release builder.
# The herd's first milk and wool lots land on days 8-11 and the same-day sale
# reservation is what takes their price before a rival's lot lands; the two middle
# days of the tape's own schedule give that up.  Three fresh mirror blocks against
# the step-288 build: 32-0 (+147), 30-2 (+11), 30-2 (+10); and against the shallow
# 6/4 baseline the new build is if anything stronger, not weaker: 28-4 (+556) vs
# 28-4 (+406), 29-3 (+272), 31-1 (+359) vs 31-1 (+349).  Per-item horizons instead of
# one global horizon change nothing once the window starts at 192 (28 of 32 games
# identical), so the one-line gate is the whole change.

# v9 RACEPX: lead-sell a planned lot early only while its book is not glutted.
#
# The engine prices a product off the market inventory: below I0 the quote is above
# base, above I0 it is below.  The lead sale moves a lot one turn ahead of the tape's
# own plan, which is what takes the price when both sides hold the same lot -- but
# when the book is already above I0 the same units only fetch a lower price, and the
# town drain between the two turns is not enough to pay for it.
#
# Measured against the frozen top-20 streams the shipped build realizes below-base
# prices on exactly the products it floods (strawberry $107-123 vs a $120 base, milk
# $98-107 vs $160, wool $129-139 vs $200, melon $212 vs $250, fertilizer $43 vs $100)
# and above base on the ones the town drains (wheat $38 vs $25, carrot $54 vs $35,
# tomato $125 vs $60, egg $52 vs $50).
#
# This layer keeps the lead sale for products quoted at or above base + MARGIN and
# leaves the rest to the tape's own schedule.  The reservation (`_r36_reserve`) is
# untouched, so the RACE horizon still governs how far ahead lots may be pulled.

# reservation runs with horizon 8; if the rival is then observed selling a race product at the
# very turn the same product was dropped into our shed while we did not sell it (public market
# inventory change beyond town consumption; no own realized sale; own shed stock rose), the rival
# quotes at the drop and the horizon escalates to 24 for the rest of the game.
