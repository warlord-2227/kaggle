#           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
#           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

# 
#       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
#       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
#       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
#       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
#       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
#       the conditions stated in this License.
# 
#    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
#       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
#       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

#    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

#       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
#       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
#       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
# 
#    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
#       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
#       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
#       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
#       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
#       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
#       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
#       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
#       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
#       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
#       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
# 
#    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
#       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
#       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
#       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
#       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
#       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

#       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
#       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
#       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"""Kaggriculture route-replay chassis (pure Python, stdlib only).

A *route* is a pre-computed tape of 719 Kaggle-format actions
``{"farmer": [op, ...], "hands": [[op, ...], ...], "market": [[order, item, qty], ...]}``.
The chassis replays the tape chosen by a caller-supplied ``router`` and wraps it
in small reactive layers (each independently switchable via ``settings``):

    hand_align            pad/truncate hands to the real hand count      (fieldbook_logic)
    weed_repair           DIG a weed that blocks PLANT/BUILD, replay      (tetsutani + task spec)
    sell_lead             sell next step's lots one step early            (fieldbook _lead_sale)
    front_run             sell before the opponent's scheduled SELL       (hook; opponent_plan)
    budget_guard          fund each 72-step block's purchases             (six_day_budget_guard.hpp)
    room_guard            keep shed <= 99 at hour 23                      (tetsutani)
    clamp_sells           trim SELL orders to the projected shed          (tetsutani)
    dead_stock            sell stock the route will never sell            (tetsutani)
    terminal_liquidation  step >= 718: sell the whole projected shed      (fieldbook _terminal_sale)

Engine facts (verified against kaggle_environments 1.32.7, env_1_32_7.py):
